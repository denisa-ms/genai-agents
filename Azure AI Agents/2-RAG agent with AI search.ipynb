    "    2) AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4o_DEPLOYMENT_NAME - The deployment name of the AI model, as found under the \"Name\" column in \n",
    "       the \"Models + endpoints\" tab in your Azure AI Foundry project.\n",
    "    3) AZURE_AI_SEARCH_CONNECTION_ID - The connection ID of the Azure AI Search resource, as found in the \"Connections\" tab\n",
